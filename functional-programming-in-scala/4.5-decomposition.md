#4.5 Decomposition

- Put the expression in the trait itself?  Seems like common sense.
- Very pervasive if you want to add another method to the trait.
- Classification and access methods: quadratic explosion.
- Type tests and casts: low level and unsafe.
- OO decomposition does not always work, need to touch all classes to add new method.
