#5.3 Implicit Parameters

- Already a standard library class to represent orderings, `Ordering[T]`.
- The `implicit` parameter will let the compiler try to synthesize the correct parameter type.
- Can then omit the `implicit` parameter in several cases.
- The compiler will search for an implicit definition that:
    - is marked `implicit`.
    - has a type compatible with `T`.
    - is visible at the point of the function call, or is defined in a companion object associated with type `T`.
