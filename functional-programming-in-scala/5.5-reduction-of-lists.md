#5.5 Reduction of Lists

- `reduceLeft()` inserts a binary operator between adjacent items in a list.
    - Can calculate sum or product.
    - Need to prime the "accumulator" with a value, which is actually becomes the left-most operator, think of a tree.
- `(x,y) => x*y` can be reduced to `(_ * _)`.
    - Every `_` represents a new parameter, going left-to-right.
- `foldLeft()` is like `reduceLeft()` except that it has a more explicit accumulator.
- For operators that are associative and commutative, `foldLeft()` and `foldRight()` are the equivalent.
    - Not always the case, for example implementing a `concat()` you want to use `foldRight()`, otherwise you'd get a type error.
