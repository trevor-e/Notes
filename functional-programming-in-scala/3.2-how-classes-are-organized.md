#3.2 How Classes Are Organized

##Traits
- Scala, like Java, has only single inheritance.
- Can be declared just like an abstract class.
- Traits are similar to interfaces, except can contain fields and concrete methods.  Seems like default interfaces in Java.
- A class can have multiple Traits.
- Traits can never have parameters.

##Class hierarchy
- Any is the super class of everything.
- AnyValue
    - Subclasses are the primitive values, such as Int, Float, etc.
- AnyRef
    - Subclasses are object types.
- Null
    - Represents an AnyRef with no value.
- Nothing
    - Represents an AnyValue with no value.
    
##Nothing type
- Why is it useful?
    - Signals an abnormal termination, such as a value not being computed.
    - Can represent an empty Collection value.
    
##Exceptions
- Similar to Java's exceptions
