#4.1 Functions as Objects

- The function type A => B is really just an abbreviation for scala.Function[A,B]
- Anonymous functions are really:

```java
(x: Int) => x * x
```

converts to:

```java
new Function1[Int, Int] {
    def apply(x: Int) = x * x
}
```

`f(7)` is shorthand for `f.apply(7)`

- eta expansion is the term in lambda calculus
