#4.6 Pattern Matching

- Case class, used for pattern matching.
- Implicitly defines companion objects with `apply()` methods, so you can write `Number(1)` instead of `new Number(1)`.
- Pattern matching is a generalization of `switch` from Java to class hierarchies.
- Uses `match` keyword.
- Patterns are constructed from constructors, variables, wildcard patterns, and constants.
- The same variable can be used only once in a match.
- Patterns are matched in order.
