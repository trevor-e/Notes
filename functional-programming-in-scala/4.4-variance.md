#4.4 Variance

- A type that accepts mutation of its elements should not be covariant.
- Immutable types can be covariant, if some conditions are met.
- If `C[T]` is a parameterized type where `A <: B`, then:
    - C is covariant: `C[A] <: C[B]`
    - C is contravariant: `C[A] >: C[B]`
    - C is nonvariant: C[A] and C[B] are not subtypes of the other
- If `A2 <: A1` and `B1 <: B2` then `A1 => B1 <: A2 => B2`.
- Arguments are contravariant in their argument types and covariant in their result type.
