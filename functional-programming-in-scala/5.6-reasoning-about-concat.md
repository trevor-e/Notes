#5.6 Reasoning About Concat

- Referential transparency: can freely apply reduction steps as equalities to some part of a term.
- Structural induction is analgous to natural induction:
- To prove a property `P(xs)` for all lists `xs`:
    - Show that `P(nil)` holds true (base case).
    - For a list `xs` that has some element `x`, show that if `P(xs)` holds then `P(x :: xs)` also holds (inductive step).
