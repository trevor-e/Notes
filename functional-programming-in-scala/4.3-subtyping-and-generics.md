#4.3 Subtyping and Generics

`def assertAllPos[S <: IntSet](r: S): S = ...`

- `<:` is an upper-bound of the type parameter S, meaning S can only be instantiated to subtypes of S.
- `S <: T` means S is a subtype of T.
- `S >: T` means S is a supertype of T, or T is a subtype of S.

- Can have lower, upper, or mixed bounds.
- Covariant: the subtyping relationship varies with the type parameter.
- Covariance allows for a hole in the type checking system that the compiler cannot detect, and will fail sometimes at runtime.
    - In Java, an array super-type can be assigned to an array subtype, eg IntSet and NonEmpty.
    - Arrays need to store a type tag to check at runtime if there's a type error.
    
Liskov Substitution Principle:
- If `A <: B` then everything one can do with a value of type B one should be able to do with a value of type A.

- Arrays are not co-variant in Scala.
